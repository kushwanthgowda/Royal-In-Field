	Farming is an agricultural process of harvesting solar energy in the form of economic produce of plants and animals. The Indian farmers depend a great deal on the monsoon rain for water. Monsoons sometimes bring very heavy rain and cause floods. Sometimes there are dry spells which lead to drought conditions. Also, the amount of rainfall in a particular season is not dependable. Therefore, the small and marginal farmers, particularly in the rain-fed regions cannot take the risk of growing specialized crops. They prefer a farming system, called Mixed Cropping which is the practice of growing of two or more crops simultaneously in the same piece of land.<br>
	<br>
	<h4> ADVANTAGES OF MIXED CROPPING </h4>
	</center>
	<ul>
	<li> The risk of total crop failure due to due to uncertain monsoon is reduced.</li>
	<li> Farmer tend to harvest a variety of produce such as cereals, pulses or vegetables or fodder to meet the various requirements of family or of an agricultural farm.</li>
	<li> Due to complementary effect of component crops, yield of both crops is increased. eg: wheat and gram.</li>
	<li> Fertility of the soil is improved by growing two crops simultaneously.</li>
	<li> Changes of pest infestation are greatly reduced.</li>
	</ul>
