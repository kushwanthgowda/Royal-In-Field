	They are natural fertilizers. They are bulky source of organic matter which supply nutrients in small quantities, and organic matter in large quantities. Manures are prepared by decomposed animals extract and plants waste. Manures include farmyard manure (FYM) , compost , Green manures, vermicompost, etc.<br>
	<br>
	<h4> ADVANTAGES OF MANURES </h4>
	</center>
	<ul>
	<li> Manures enrich the soil with nutrients. They replenish the general deficiency of nutrients in the soil. Since manures contain less nutrients they need to be used in large quantities.</li>
	<li> Manures add organic matter (called humus) to the soil which restore the soil texture, for better retention of water and aeration of soil. For example, organic matter present in the Manures Increase the water holding capacity in Sandy soils and drainage in clayey soil they also prevent water logging in clay soils.   </li>
	<li> The organic matter in manures provides food for the soil organism (Decomposers such as bacteria, fungi,   etc) which helps in providing nutrients to plant.  </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	Thus, organic manures helps to improve the physical properties of soil, reduce soil erosion increase their moisture Holding capacity of soil and are  low-cost nutrient carriers. Using biological waste material is way of recycling the farm waste. Manures protect our environment from synthetic chemicals.<br>

	<h4> DIS-ADVANTAGES OF MANURES </h4>
	</center>
	<ul>
	<li>Manures are bulky with are low nutrient content. The nutrient get release slowly, unable to fulfill the high and rapid demand of nutrient required by improved high yielding hybrids varieties of crops. Being bulky and voluminous, they are inconvenient to handle, store and transport. Moreover, Manures are not a nutrient specific and hence, are not much useful when a particular nutrient is required in the soil for a particular crop.</li><br>
