	Field crops are infected with a variety of pests. A pest is any destructive organism which causes great economic loss by destroying crop plants or products obtained from them. Pests of crop plants include weeds, insects, Mites, nematodes, rodents, fungi, bacteria and viruses. Field crops are infected by large number of patients and diseases. If these pets are not controlled at appropriate time they can damage the crops to the extent of 50 to 70 percent.<br>
	<br>
	There are various methods by which insects and diseases can be controlled. One of the most common and effective methods is use of pesticides or biocides which include insecticides, weedicides and fungicides. Thus, chemicals used to kill pests, weeds, insects, mites Rodents and fungi are called pesticides. These chemicals are sprayed on crop Plants or used for treating seeds and soil. However one should try to avoid the use of these toxic chemicals as they causes environmental pollution. In fact, it would be far better if we adopt the preventive measures rather than allowing the crops to be infected by pests and then control them by pesticides. Some of the preventive measures of pests are the following <br>
